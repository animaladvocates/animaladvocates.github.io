biographical_notes: |-
  Sandra Larson majored in biology as an undergraduate, planning to become a veterinarian.  A certified biology teacher, she also once worked as an assistant to a large animal veterinarian and subsequently as a microbiologist at a large corporation that manufactured blood products for culture media.
  After moving to Massachusetts, Larson worked as Senior Research Assistant at the Joslin Diabetes Center.  When she realized that many of the animals in the labs came from pounds in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, she joined with other grassroots activists, visiting town councils in Massachusetts, urging them to stop selling “their” pound dogs to research labs.
  Larson was later appointed to the NEAVS Board of Directors and became one of the primary organizers of NEAVS’ Campaign to Repeal Pound Seizure with the goal of “making pound seizure a household word in Massachusetts.”
  Following the success of the campaign, Larson proposed starting a humane education program for NEAVS.  She also happily resigned from her job at Joslin.  Larson’s educational program, the LivingEarth Learning Project (LELP), presented nearly 1,000 programs in humane education at more than 350 schools in New England and New York every year.
  In 1989, Larson moved to Connecticut but continued to work for NEAVS as an educational field representative.  She and Connecticut resident Pat Butterfield formed the Ethical Science Education Coalition (now named the Ethical Science and Education Coalition), providing a grassroots series of presentations to boards of education urging that students be allowed to choose non-animal methods to learn anatomy.
  Larson, at the time of this recording, operates an animal sanctuary in Connecticut.
