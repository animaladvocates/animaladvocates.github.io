biographical_notes: "Will Anderson was blessed to have two loving parents who gave
  their all while raising him and his sister in the Midwest. He was born in Chicago,
  IL, on May 26, 1948. Will and his family remained in the city for several years
  before moving to the suburb of Hoffman Estates to the northwest. Will has always
  had a love of walking and exploring. It is perhaps his walking adventures to Chicago’s
  Lincoln Park, its lagoon and the adjacent shoreline of Lake Michigan that gave him
  his appreciation of the outdoors and other, nonhuman life – even while living in
  the city. He often took the bus to the Museum of Natural History, a favorite place
  of wonder. Though living in the suburbs until finishing high school, Will’s home
  was set in the midst of vast cornfields, wetlands and open spaces. Some time during
  these early years, Will developed a deep and abiding sense of empathy for all.\n\n
  \       In 1966, Will moved with his family to the Seattle area. After a semester
  at Eastern Illinois University, will enrolled in the US Air Force and chose to become
  a survival instructor based at Spokane, Washington. After three years, Will declared
  himself to be a conscientious objector, was put under barrack’s arrest and underwent
  a fractured process before favorable findings resulted in his discharge.\n\n        The
  next several years involved a return to school at Western Washington University
  for a short time (Human Ecology), a move to Alaska where he founded Greenpeace Alaska,
  was Director of the Alaska region (becoming a board member of Greenpeace USA), worked
  on the Alaska pipeline. At this time he began his lengthy trips to be with the gray
  whales in Baja, Mexico. After nearly seven years in Alaska (often seasonally), Will
  moved to Hawaii where he worked on a commercial catamaran that took tourists snorkeling
  and whale watching. Eventually he moved to Boston, again working for Greenpeace
  in many capacities. \n\n        With a partner, Will opened the first of several
  environmentally-themed gift stores called Ecology House. The first was in Lahaina,
  Hawaii (second time living there), then Provincetown, MA and again in Portland,
  ME when they began selling franchises to open stores in other cities. While in Maine,
  Will co-founded the Maine Animal Coalition. Will’s involvement in Ecology House
  ended in 1991. While in Portland, OR, Will completed his degree getting a B.Sc.
  in Business Management and Communication. From Portland, OR, Will moved to Seattle
  where for seven years he worked for the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS)
  in Lynnwood, WA.  \n\n        After PAWS, Will has worked as a real estate agent
  and director of the Orca Recovery Campaign, a project of Earth Island’s Marine Mammal
  Project (ww.saveorcawhales.org).  He remains privately involved in several issues
  and has intent in returning to the animal welfare and environmental movement full
  time."
