  Born in 1948, Carter Luke took a keen interest in wild and companion animals when he was growing up.  He received his B.A. in Mathematics and Wildlife Ecology from the University of Wisconsin, and also did graduate work in Elementary Education.  He was an elementary school teacher in Wisconsin from 1973 to 1976, and worked on and off as carpenter, painter and drywaller from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s.
  In 1977 he left teaching for the post of shelter manager and humane officer at Coulee Region Humane Society in Wisconsin.  He remained there for six years, then served as the Executive Director of Dane County Humane Society in Madison, Wisconsin.  Excited by the opportunity to work for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) when the organization took encouraging steps to recruit new staff and share its information more widely, Luke joined the MSPCA in 1985 as Director of Shelters.  He became their Vice President of Humane Services in 1988, a position he still holds.  He counts among his major accomplishments at the MSPCA the national Year of the Cat Campaign in 1993, and the positive influence he has had on  shelter workers and the sheltersâ€™ outreach activities.  He is also interested in the connection between cruelty to animals and to people.
