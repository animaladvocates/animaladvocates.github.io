  Robert Cummings received his A.B. from Brown University and Tufts College in 1952 and his LL.B. from Harvard University in 1955.  After leaving in the United States Army in 1957, he joined the prominent Boston law firm which is now named Nixon Peabody LLP.  The focus of his law practice is on public utilities law, general corporate law, non-profits, and litigation.  He has been a managing partner of the firm for many years, and has served on the boards of various community organizations.

  Cummings has been actively associated with the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) for over forty years, an involvement which started when he acted as a primary lawyer of the law firm’s MSPCA account early in his legal career.  He is currently the Chairman of the MSPCA’s Board of Directors.  He is also the Director and Treasurer of the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), an organization which was formed in 1956 by the MSPCA and Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the UK.  The particular roles he has played in these organizations and his legal background have given him insights into different areas of animal protection including: legal and criminal aspects of animal cruelty; fundraising; publicity, outreach, and education; overseas projects; animal shelters; vivisection; and transport and slaughter of animals.
