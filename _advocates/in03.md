biographical_notes: "Ann Cottrell Free (b. 1916, Richmond, Virginia) is a journalist,
  author and poet, who, since childhood, has worked through her writings and actions
  to protect animals and unfortunate human beings. \nAs a Washington correspondent
  she helped to initiate and hasten the passage of a variety of animal and environmental
  protective laws.  She can be credited with the first Congressional action to help
  laboratory animals, having blown the whistle on the Food and Drug Administration’s
  cruel incarceration of hundreds of laboratory dogs.  This led to an unprecedented
  Congressional appropriation for more humane housing. Her articles on animal theft
  and laboratory animal mistreatment helped to bring about public demand for legislation
  and enactment of the Animal Welfare Act. \nHer testimony before a Congressional
  committee brought an end to the National Zoo’s deer hunts at its endangered species
  preserve in Virginia.  She also wrote widely about the need for a Federal Humane
  Slaughter Act and for livestock protection. \nHer three books, Forever the Wild
  Mare, Animals, Nature and Albert Schweitzer and No Room, Save in the Heart, are
  about animals.  She was awarded the Rachel Carson Legacy Award by the Rachel Carson
  Council for her role in establishing a national wildlife refuge in coastal Maine,
  named for Carson.  There was great public response when she had called for such
  a refuge in a national magazine article.  The Department of Interior also honored
  her for this effort.  The Animal Welfare Institute gave her its Albert Schweitzer
  medal for her work in improving conditions for laboratory animals.  Also, humane
  societies in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area have given her awards.  In 1987
  she spearheaded a campaign to establish a humane society on the impoverished Puerto
  Rican island of Vieques. \nDuring World War II she wrote widely about “guns and
  butter” and other home front restrictions, the establishment of the women military
  services, the return of wounded soldiers and preparation for helping war refugees
  in Europe.  \nAlso, was active in civil and women’s rights, having chaired Eleanor
  Roosevelt’s Press Conference Association.  In Alabama in the 1960s, she spoke out
  against racial oppression and later, she helped reform a home for the blind in Washington,
  D.C.\nIn China, while with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,
  she blew the whistle on the Chiang Kai-shek government’s diversion of relief supplies
  from starving people.  She served in France and Italy with the Marshall Plan, reporting
  on the rebuilding of Western Europe.  \nShe began her journalism career on The Richmond
  Times- Dispatch before becoming a Washington correspondent for Newsweek, The Chicago
  Sun and The New York Herald Tribune.  Her articles were widely distributed by the
  North American Newspaper Alliance.  Her writings have also appeared in many magazines
  as well as in several anthologies and encyclopedias.  She was inducted into the
  Virginia Communications Hall of Fame and appears in “Who’s Who in America”. \nAnn
  Cottrell Free graduated from Barnard College in 1938 and, in 1950, married James
  Stillman Free, Washington correspondent for The Birmingham News (deceased, 1996).
  \ She is the mother of journalist Elissa Blake Free, grandmother of student Amanda
  Blake Nooter and mother-in-law of William Ward Nooter, Magistrate Judge for the
  Superior Court of the District of Columbia."
