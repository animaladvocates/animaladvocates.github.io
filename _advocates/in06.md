  John Francis Kullberg was born in Cranston, Rhode Island on April 16, 1939.  At the age of 16 he left home to become a member of a religious teaching Order, which he left eight years later, just before he would have had to permanently commit to the monastic vow of obedience, which he believed conflicted with personal responsibility.

          He received a bachelor of arts degree with a major in English literature from The Catholic University of America (1962), a master of arts degree with a major in English literature from the University of Rhode Island (1967), and a doctor of education degree with a major in college and university administration from Columbia University (1976).  He also was a graduate student at Manhattan College and the University of Illinois.  He was a teaching assistant while pursuing a master of arts degree at the University of Rhode Island and was awarded a W. K. Kellogg Fellowship to pursue doctoral studies at Columbia University’s Teachers College.  In 1977 he was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship at the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to study federal support of higher education.

          He taught English literature and chaired English departments at St. Raphael Academy (Pawtucket, Rhode Island, 1962-64) and Parkland College (Champaign, Illinois, 1967-69).  Representing the Baldridge Reading Services he taught a multi- week course in reading and study skills at several preparatory schools and colleges (1964-66).  He also was director of admissions and assistant dean of the Columbia University School of Law (1970-77), president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1978-91), and president of Guiding Eyes for the Blind (1991-93).  He currently is executive director of the Humane Society of the United States Wildlife Land Trust (1994-present).

          He has served on the boards of directors of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the American Humane Association, the New York State Humane Association, and the National Coalition to Protect Our Pets.  He is currently a member of the boards of directors of the Humane Society of the United States Wildlife Land Trust, the Farm Animal Reform Movement, and the Society for Animal Protective Legislation.  He was board chairman of the National Coalition to Protect Our Pets and is currently board president of the Society for Animal Protective Legislation.  He also is an advisor to the Food Animal Concerns Trust.

          He is the author of The Communication Laboratory (the Dictaphone Corporation, 1971), a teachers guide to using dictation equipment to advance the language arts of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, a program he pioneered while at Parkland College, and was retained by the Dictaphone Corporation as a consultant to teachers and school superintendents evaluating and introducing communication laboratory instruction (1969-1972).  He co-authored Women and the Law (CATALYST, 1974), a booklet for women interested in the legal profession, and was the principal editor of The Animal Rights Handbook (The Living Planet Press, 1990), a guide to compassionate lifestyles which sold more than 400,000 copies.  He was executive producer of Where Have All The Dolphins Gone, an award-winning television documentary on the cruelties involved in purse-seine tuna fishing that was featured on the Discovery Channel on Earth Day, 1989.  He has authored several published articles, including a New York Times Op-Ed essay that helped initiate a national debate on how to fully and permanently fund the capital and operating budgets of municipal animal shelters.  He continues to promote rights-related issues through television and radio interviews, published letters, articles, and college lectures.

          He has been honored by New York City’s Mid-Manhattan Chamber of Commerce as their Man of the Year (1986), by Teachers College of Columbia University as a Distinguished Alumnus (1992), and by the Pegasus Foundation for Leadership in Habitat Preservation (2000).
