biographical_notes: |-
  Theodora Capaldo was born in Massachusetts in 1948.  A licensed psychologist with more than twenty-five years of experience in her field, she holds a Doctorate of Education from Boston University and an M.A. in Applied Clinical Practices in Psychology from the University of Hartford.  She is a member of the American Psychological Association, the Massachusetts Psychological Association, and the Board of Psychological Specialties of the American Board of Forensic Examiners.  She has taught college-level psychology and served as the director of counseling at a liberal arts college.  As a practicing psychotherapist, she has worked extensively with individuals and couples.
  Capaldo was first exposed to vivisection in her sixth grade through a New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVS) publication.  Her sensitivity to animal issues brought to her practice an awareness of:  the connection between animal and human abuse; the consequences of being forced to participate in animal use/abuse; and an understanding of what contributes to moral development and compassion.
  Her animal advocacy work paralleled her career as a psychologist.  She has served on the board of several national animal advocacy organizations in the U.S., including Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PsyETA).  She is co-founder of the Carriage Horse Action Committee of Boston and was New England Regional Outreach Coordinator for the Mobilization for Animalsâ€™ primate rallies.  She also co-coordinated an Endangered Species in Oriental Medicine grassroots outreach effort that reached alternative medicine facilities throughout the U.S.  She is currently President and Executive Director of NEAVS and its educational affiliate, the Ethical Science and Education Coalition (ESEC).
