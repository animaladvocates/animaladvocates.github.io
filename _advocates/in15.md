  Ethel Thurston was born in Minnesota in 1911.  Her father was professor of law at the University of Minnesota, later at Yale, then Harvard.  She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College in 1933 with majors in music and psychology.  She continued studies in music with Nadia Boulanger in Paris (1938), and became Mlle Boulanger’s teaching assistant.  These plans were interrupted by the Nazi invasion and occupation of France (1940).
  She escaped Hitler’s invading army on a bicycle and assisted Mlle Boulanger to travel across Spain to Lisbon (Portugal), where Thurston’s father had managed to secure passage for both to New York.  Mlle Boulanger’s fifteen pieces of luggage included historical documents which had to leave France (under Nazi Occupation) urgently, quietly, and secretly.  Thurston took all fifteen pieces, sometimes traveling separately, to New York.
  Since then, Thurston has taught harmony, counterpoint, music history, and research methods at Manhattan College of Music, and some of these at Hunter College, St. John’s University, Bryn Mawr, and other colleges.  She earned her Ph.D. in music from New York University in 1954 and retired from teaching in 1973.
  Since 1973 her energies have been volunteered as head of the national animal protection societies she founded: Beauty Without Cruelty USA, and the American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research.  The first provides information where to purchase personal and household products made and tested without harm to animals; the second provides financial grants to develop non-animal testing systems.
