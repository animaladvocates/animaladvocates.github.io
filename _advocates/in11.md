biographical_notes: "Tom Regan is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina (USA). During his more than thirty years on the faculty, he received numerous awards for excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching; was named University Alumni Distinguished Professor; published hundreds of professional papers and more than twenty books; won major international awards for film writing and direction; and presented hundreds of lectures throughout the United States and abroad.  In 2000, he received the William Quarles Holliday Medal, the highest honor NC State University can bestow on one of its faculty.<br><br>Among his books, two (<em>The Case for Animal Rights</em> and <em>Bloomsbury’s Prophet: G. E. Moore and the Development of his Moral Philosophy</em>) were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. <em>The Case for Animal Rights</em> was immediately recognized as a “modern classic” when it first appeared in 1983.  Already translated into Italian, Swedish, and Dutch, <em>The Case for Animal Rights</em> will be issued in a German edition in 2002. Other of Tom Regan’s books that touch on the topic of animal rights are <em>All That Dwell Therein: Essays on Animal Rights and Environmental Ethics</em> (1982); <em>Animal Sacrifices: Religious Perspectives on the Use of Animals in Science</em> (1986), <em>The Struggle for Animal Rights</em> (1987), <em>The Thee Generation: Reflections on the Coming Revolution</em> (1991), <em>Defending Animal Rights</em> (2001) and (with Carl Cohen) <em>The Animal Rights Debate</em> (2001).  He is universally recognized as the intellectual leader of the animal rights movement. <br><br>For its part, <em>Bloomsbury’s Prophet</em> has helped reenergize and redirect Moorean scholarship in particular and the study of early twentieth century British philosophy in general.  In addition to <em>Bloomsbury’s Prophet</em>, Tom Regan’s other major contributions to Moorean scholarship are <em>Moore: The Early Essays</em> (1987) and <em>G. E. Moore: The Elements of Ethics</em> (1991).  He is co-founder and past president of the Moore Society. Tom Regan’s major film awards include the Silver Medal for <em>We Are All Noah</em> (International Film Festival of New York, 1986) and the Gold Medal for <em>Voices I Have Heard</em> (Houston International Film Festival, 1988).  Tom Regan is married to the former Nancy Tirk, with whom he co-founded The Culture & Animals Foundation."
