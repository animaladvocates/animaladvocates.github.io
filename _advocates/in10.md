biographical_notes: 'Barbara Orlans was brought up in England and came to the United
  States in 1956 after obtaining a Ph.D. in physiology from London University.  She
  conducted animal research in heart disease and later was an administrator at the
  National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  At NIH, her concern for animals
  developed to the point of becoming an activist.  In 1979 she left NIH to establish
  a nonprofit educational organization, the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare,
  of which was found president and director.  Major reform efforts have been directed
  at the use of animals in education, the recognition and assessment of animal pain,
  and strengthening the reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal experiments.  In
  1989 she joined the faculty of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University,
  Washington, DC, a position she holds in 2002.  Recent books include:  In the Name
  of Science: Issues in Responsible Animal Experimentation (1993) and The Human Use
  of Animals: Case Studies in Ethical Choice (1998), both published by Oxford University
  Press.'
