  Born in Boston in 1939 to parents who were very kind to animals, Walter Kilroyâ€™s interest in animals started in his childhood, rescuing snakes, wildlife, and lead-painted turtles. His interest in and concern for wildlife, in particular snakes, remained with him throughout his life.

  In 1955 Kilroy joined the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA), first as kennel attendant, then as veterinary nurse, ambulance and rescue driver at its Angell Memorial Hospital. For the next four decades, he held various positions in the organization, including: law enforcement / prosecuting officer (1959-60); Assistant Director of the American Fondouk - a MSPCA-affiliated animal hospital and shelter in Fez, Morocco (1961-62); Assistant Director of Law Enforcement (1963-67); Administrative Assistant to the President (1973-75); Director of Operations (1976-77); Vice President & Registered Lobbyist (1977-84); Executive Vice President (1985-87); Director of Law Enforcement (1989-present). He also served as management consultant in the project to complete the construction and programming of the African Tropical Forest at the Franklin Park Zoo in 1988-89.  Among the issues he has been involved with and written on are wildlife, trapping, zoos, pet shops, and overpopulation of animals.
