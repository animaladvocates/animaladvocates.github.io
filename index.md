The Animal Advocates Oral History Collection contains fourteen interviews with individuals who were involved in different areas of the movement to protect animals. The interviews largely focus on activities during the 1970s and 1980s, but there is also significant analysis of connections with earlier advocacy for animals and commentary on issues at the time of the interviews. Aspects of animal protection discussed include animal shelters, opposition to vivisection and scientific testing on animals, vegetarianism and veganism, treatment of agricultural animals, and environmentalism. Common themes addressed include connections between violence towards animals and violence towards humans, connections with other social justice movements, interactions between different organizations, and the religious and ethical backgrounds of narrators. There is a particular focus on activities of people and organizations in New England. Many interviews include photographs and supplemental material, such as books, publications from animal rights organizations, writings by narrators, and other ephemera. In 2015Â­2016, digital audio was created from all interview cassettes.

Interviewees in the collection are Willard Anderson, Theadora Capaldo, Robert Cummings, Ann Cottrell Free, Walter Kilroy, John F. Kullberg, Carter Luke, Sandra Rae Larson, Jim Mason, F. Barbara Orlans, Tom Regan, Margaret "Peggy" Moreland Stathos, Ethel Thurston, and Peter Singer.
