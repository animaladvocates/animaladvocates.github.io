in01,Will Anderson,"Maine Animal Coalition, Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), Orca Recovery Campaign",Charles Hardy,Animal Advocates ,30 September 2004,"Will Anderson was blessed to have two loving parents who gave their all while raising him and his sister in the Midwest. He was born in Chicago, IL, on May 26, 1948. Will and his family remained in the city for several years before moving to the suburb of Hoffman Estates to the northwest. Will has always had a love of walking and exploring. It is perhaps his walking adventures to Chicago’s Lincoln Park, its lagoon and the adjacent shoreline of Lake Michigan that gave him his appreciation of the outdoors and other, nonhuman life – even while living in the city. He often took the bus to the Museum of Natural History, a favorite place of wonder. Though living in the suburbs until finishing high school, Will’s home was set in the midst of vast cornfields, wetlands and open spaces. Some time during these early years, Will developed a deep and abiding sense of empathy for all.

        In 1966, Will moved with his family to the Seattle area. After a semester at Eastern Illinois University, will enrolled in the US Air Force and chose to become a survival instructor based at Spokane, Washington. After three years, Will declared himself to be a conscientious objector, was put under barrack’s arrest and underwent a fractured process before favorable findings resulted in his discharge.

        The next several years involved a return to school at Western Washington University for a short time (Human Ecology), a move to Alaska where he founded Greenpeace Alaska, was Director of the Alaska region (becoming a board member of Greenpeace USA), worked on the Alaska pipeline. At this time he began his lengthy trips to be with the gray whales in Baja, Mexico. After nearly seven years in Alaska (often seasonally), Will moved to Hawaii where he worked on a commercial catamaran that took tourists snorkeling and whale watching. Eventually he moved to Boston, again working for Greenpeace in many capacities. 

        With a partner, Will opened the first of several environmentally-themed gift stores called Ecology House. The first was in Lahaina, Hawaii (second time living there), then Provincetown, MA and again in Portland, ME when they began selling franchises to open stores in other cities. While in Maine, Will co-founded the Maine Animal Coalition. Will’s involvement in Ecology House ended in 1991. While in Portland, OR, Will completed his degree getting a B.Sc. in Business Management and Communication. From Portland, OR, Will moved to Seattle where for seven years he worked for the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) in Lynnwood, WA.  

        After PAWS, Will has worked as a real estate agent and director of the Orca Recovery Campaign, a project of Earth Island’s Marine Mammal Project (ww.saveorcawhales.org).  He remains privately involved in several issues and has intent in returning to the animal welfare and environmental movement full time.",environmental activism,whaling,yes,no

As a Washington correspondent she helped to initiate and hasten the passage of a variety of animal and environmental protective laws.  She can be credited with the first Congressional action to help laboratory animals, having blown the whistle on the Food and Drug Administration’s cruel incarceration of hundreds of laboratory dogs.  This led to an unprecedented Congressional appropriation for more humane housing. Her articles on animal theft and laboratory animal mistreatment helped to bring about public demand for legislation and enactment of the Animal Welfare Act. 
Her testimony before a Congressional committee brought an end to the National Zoo’s deer hunts at its endangered species preserve in Virginia.  She also wrote widely about the need for a Federal Humane Slaughter Act and for livestock protection. 
Her three books, Forever the Wild Mare, Animals, Nature and Albert Schweitzer and No Room, Save in the Heart, are about animals.  She was awarded the Rachel Carson Legacy Award by the Rachel Carson Council for her role in establishing a national wildlife refuge in coastal Maine, named for Carson.  There was great public response when she had called for such a refuge in a national magazine article.  The Department of Interior also honored her for this effort.  The Animal Welfare Institute gave her its Albert Schweitzer medal for her work in improving conditions for laboratory animals.  Also, humane societies in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area have given her awards.  In 1987 she spearheaded a campaign to establish a humane society on the impoverished Puerto Rican island of Vieques. 
During World War II she wrote widely about “guns and butter” and other home front restrictions, the establishment of the women military services, the return of wounded soldiers and preparation for helping war refugees in Europe.  
Also, was active in civil and women’s rights, having chaired Eleanor Roosevelt’s Press Conference Association.  In Alabama in the 1960s, she spoke out against racial oppression and later, she helped reform a home for the blind in Washington, D.C.
In China, while with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, she blew the whistle on the Chiang Kai-shek government’s diversion of relief supplies from starving people.  She served in France and Italy with the Marshall Plan, reporting on the rebuilding of Western Europe.  
She began her journalism career on The Richmond Times- Dispatch before becoming a Washington correspondent for Newsweek, The Chicago Sun and The New York Herald Tribune.  Her articles were widely distributed by the North American Newspaper Alliance.  Her writings have also appeared in many magazines as well as in several anthologies and encyclopedias.  She was inducted into the Virginia Communications Hall of Fame and appears in “Who’s Who in America”.

in07,Sandra Larson,"Citizens to End Animal Suffering and Exploitation (CEASE), New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVES)
",Martin Rowe,,3 December 1999,"Sandra Larson majored in biology as an undergraduate, planning to become a veterinarian.  A certified biology teacher, she also once worked as an assistant to a large animal veterinarian and subsequently as a microbiologist at a large corporation that manufactured blood products for culture media.
After moving to Massachusetts, Larson worked as Senior Research Assistant at the Joslin Diabetes Center.  When she realized that many of the animals in the labs came from pounds in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, she joined with other grassroots activists, visiting town councils in Massachusetts, urging them to stop selling “their” pound dogs to research labs.
Larson was later appointed to the NEAVS Board of Directors and became one of the primary organizers of NEAVS’ Campaign to Repeal Pound Seizure with the goal of “making pound seizure a household word in Massachusetts.”
Following the success of the campaign, Larson proposed starting a humane education program for NEAVS.  She also happily resigned from her job at Joslin.  Larson’s educational program, the LivingEarth Learning Project (LELP), presented nearly 1,000 programs in humane education at more than 350 schools in New England and New York every year.
In 1989, Larson moved to Connecticut but continued to work for NEAVS as an educational field representative.  She and Connecticut resident Pat Butterfield formed the Ethical Science Education Coalition (now named the Ethical Science and Education Coalition), providing a grassroots series of presentations to boards of education urging that students be allowed to choose non-animal methods to learn anatomy.

Her father was professor of law at the University of Minnesota, later at Yale, then Harvard.  She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College in 1933 with majors in music and psychology.  She continued studies in music with Nadia Boulanger in Paris (1938), and became Mlle Boulanger’s teaching assistant.  These plans were interrupted by the Nazi invasion and occupation of France (1940).
She escaped Hitler’s invading army on a bicycle and assisted Mlle Boulanger to travel across Spain to Lisbon (Portugal), where Thurston’s father had managed to secure passage for both to New York.  Mlle Boulanger’s fifteen pieces of luggage included historical documents which had to leave France (under Nazi Occupation) urgently, quietly, and secretly.  Thurston took all fifteen pieces, sometimes traveling separately, to New York.
Since then, Thurston has taught harmony, counterpoint, music history, and research methods at Manhattan College of Music, and some of these at Hunter College, St. John’s University, Bryn Mawr, and other colleges.

in09,Jim Mason,"Friends of Animals, Two Mauds Inc",Martin Rowe,,"8 July 1999, 16-17 November 1999","Jim Mason is an author and attorney who focuses on human/animal concerns. His co-authored book, with ethicist Peter Singer, is The Ethics of What We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter (Rodale Press, 2006). The authors trace the foods eaten by three American families back to their sources and explore the ethical questions that arise along the way. The book discusses factory farming and alternatives, fair trade, buying local, organic farming, commercial fishing, and other food matters of concern to consumers today.

His book, An Unnatural Order: The Roots of Our Destruction of Nature (Lantern Books, 2005), looks at the historical and cultural roots of the Western belief in God-given dominion over the living world. In enslaving animals for war and farming, he says, agrarian society broke the ancient bonds and sense of kinship with them. This makes for an alienated, nature-hating culture, Mason argues. It fouls our relations with nature — especially animals, whom we need, he says, “as companions, as exercisers of human empathy and nurturing, as feeders and informers of the psyche, and as kin and continuum with the rest of the living world.”

Mason is best known for his 1980 book, Animal Factories, written with philosopher, Peter Singer. The book examined America’s brave new world of factory farming in which crowded, drugged animals mass-produce cheap meat, milk, and eggs. In the process, Mason and Singer say, animal factories also mass-produce environmental pollution and threats to human health while they destroy independent, diversified farming.",,,,
